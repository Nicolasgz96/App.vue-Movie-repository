## Overview

The Movie Library App allows users to browse through a curated list of movies, view details about each movie, and rate them based on their preferences. The app provides an intuitive interface to manage movie data, including options to add new movies, edit existing entries, and delete records, all from an elegant, responsive UI.

The core objective of this project is to create a highly interactive and user-friendly movie collection management system. It is designed with a mobile-first approach and integrates modern frontend development practices.

## Features

- **Browse Movie Collection:** Users can view a collection of movies with details such as title, description, genres, and ratings.
- **Dynamic Ratings:** Interactive star-based rating system that lets users rate movies on a 1 to 5-star scale.
- **Movie Management:** Add, edit, or delete movies from the library using a modal form.
- **Image Uploading:** Supports uploading images for movies, either via file selection or providing an image URL.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices using Tailwind CSS.
- **Interactive Modals:** Toggle popups for movie actions (e.g., adding new movies) with form validation and real-time feedback.

## Technologies Used

- **Vue.js 3:** A modern JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework used for building custom designs without leaving your HTML.
- **Heroicons:** Icons used for buttons and actions, providing a clean and visually appealing interface.
- **Vite:** A fast frontend build tool, ensuring quick setup and development.
- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Leverages modern JavaScript features like modules, async/await, and more.
